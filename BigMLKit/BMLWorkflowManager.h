/**
 *  A BMLWorkflowManager allows to keep track of multiple BMLWorkflows while they are
 *  executing. It can also be easily modified so it allows to handle a log of all
 *  past and present workflows.
 *  This is accomplished by means of a NSArrayController which exposes task details and allows
 *  to peek into their current/final state. The manager is responsible to update
 *  the task status as it changes.
 *  Besides this, this class' main aim is to relieve from having to keep workflows alive while they
 *  are running and to make it easier to run multiple workflows at the same time.
 *
 *  This class is only provided on OS X due to its dependency from NSArrayController.
